# Letenkov I/O

This organization represents the technical space behind
https://letenkov.io — a place for engineering reflections and architectural reasoning.

We focus on:
- system design and trade-offs
- operational stability at scale
- platform engineering insights
- long-term consequences of decisions

This is not a community project or open-call initiative;
it is a structured home for technical notes and curated examples.
